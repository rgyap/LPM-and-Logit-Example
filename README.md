*Flavor Text.* Peter Firsov works in the car loan division of a major commercial bank. He wants to use a data-driven strategy to identify borrowers who are likely to default on the automobile loan. 

The data includes the historical data for 400 customers containing information on 
- whether the customer defaulted (`Default`),
- corresponding loan-to-value ratio (`LTV`, in %),
- FICO credit score (`FICO`), 
- and age (`Age`).
